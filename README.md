# Shortest-Knight-Path

Given two different positions on a chess board, find the least number of moves it would take a knight to get from one to the other. The positions will be passed as two arguments in algebraic notation. For example, _knight("a3", "b5")_ should return 1.

The knight is not allowed to move off the board. The board is 8x8.

(Warning: many of the tests were generated randomly. If any do not work, the test cases will return the input, output, and expected output; please post them.)
